/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * The first line of defence against floods and runaway scripts: Cloudflare's
 * Workers Rate Limiting bindings, checked in the Worker before the app (and so
 * before D1, Google, a model or an outbound fetch) is touched. A binding keeps
 * its counters in the Cloudflare location serving the request, with no database
 * write and no network wait, so refusing a flood costs almost nothing. It is
 * permissive and eventually consistent by design (a burst can slip a few
 * requests past, and each location counts for itself), which is what a cost
 * guard wants; the exact, durable counters that matter (the daily budgets, the
 * OAuth registration limit) stay in D1 in the app.
 *
 * Every request that is not a static file belongs to one class. Each class has
 * its own binding, whose limit and period are declared in `wrangler.jsonc` (a
 * period is 10 or 60 seconds), and says who is counted: the caller's network
 * address, or, for the signed-in API, the person (a hash of their session
 * cookie, so many people behind one office address do not share a budget).
 * Because a cookie can be made up, those classes are also counted per address
 * in one roomy overall bucket.
 *
 * The limiter runs before the edge copy of a page is looked up, so a page that
 * is cached still counts against the caller: being cheap to serve does not make
 * it free to request over and over.
 *
 * The classes every app has (pages, the API, pictures, discovery files and
 * browser reports) are here. An app with more adds its own, and says which
 * request belongs to which, in its `extras.ts`. The limiter fails open: a
 * missing binding (local development, tests) or one that throws lets the
 * request through.
