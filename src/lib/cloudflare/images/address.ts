 * Our own addresses for pictures that live on other websites. Loading them
 * straight from there is slow (a new connection per site, full-size files),
 * leaks which pages you open to every site (referrers, cookies), breaks when a
 * site blocks hotlinking, and forces the Content Security Policy to name every
 * picture host. So pages ask our own `/img` for them (see `service.ts`):
 * it fetches the picture once, scales it down, and keeps a copy at the edge.
 *
 * This module is the part pages use, so it holds no server code: building
 * those addresses and deciding which pictures are ours to proxy. Which hosts
 * and widths an app uses is in `site.ts`.
