 *
 * What an MCP tool is, and the effect hints and argument spellings it declares
 * about itself.
 *
 * A tool is one class. It carries the name an assistant calls, what the
 * catalogue says about it, the schema its arguments are checked against, the
 * looser spellings it forgives, and the code that runs. Nothing about a tool
 * lives in a table beside it, so a tool that forgets any part of itself does
 * not compile and a tool advertised without an implementation cannot be
 * written down.
 *
 * {@link McpTool} is generic over the context its tools are given, which is
 * whatever an app's tools need: a database, a user, an access token. It is
 * generic over the structured content they return as well, so an app that draws
 * its results in a view can give that content its own type. The library never
 * names any of them, so it carries no knowledge of the app it serves.
