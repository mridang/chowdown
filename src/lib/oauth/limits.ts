 * Rate limits for the OAuth endpoints that anyone on the internet can reach
 * without signing in: registering a client, making us fetch a client's metadata
 * document, and asking for tokens. Each is a fixed-window counter in D1 (see
 * `util/rate-limit`) keyed by whoever is asking; a request over its limit is
 * answered with 429 and a `Retry-After`.
 *
 * Counting is best-effort. If the counter cannot be reached the request goes
 * ahead (and the failure is logged): a broken limiter must never lock every
 * assistant out of the app.

 * cannot use up the overall allowance for everyone else) and overall (nobody can
 * make us a fetch proxy); the token and revoke endpoints allow far more than any
 * real client uses per address, since an assistant's servers share addresses
