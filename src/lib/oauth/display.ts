 * How an OAuth client is described to the person who has to approve it. The
 * approval screen is the only defence against a look-alike app asking for a
 * token that can change their recipes, so everything a client says about itself
 * is cleaned before it is shown, and everything we can know about it for sure
 * (the domain its `client_id` lives on, where approving sends them) is shown
 * next to what it merely claims (its name).
 *
 * Nothing here renders HTML: the functions return plain text, and React escapes
 * it. They are pure so the rules can be tested without a page.
