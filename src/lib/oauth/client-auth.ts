 * Client authentication at the token endpoint for clients that sign in with
 * `private_key_jwt` (RFC 7523, OpenID Connect Core §9). Such a client names a
 * `jwks_uri` in its metadata document; each token request then carries a
 * `client_assertion`, a JWT it signed with the matching private key. Checking
 * it proves the caller holds that key, so a stolen authorization code or refresh
 * token is of no use on its own. The signature and claim checks are `jose`'s;
 * what is decided here is what a valid assertion must say and that it is used
 * only once.
