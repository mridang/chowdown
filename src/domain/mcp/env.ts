/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * Reading optional settings from the Cloudflare environment without assuming
 * there is one (tests and scripts run without it).
 *
 * The one setting the MCP endpoint reads is `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, a
 * comma-separated list of extra browser origins that may call it, written as the
 * browser sends them (`https://tool.example`, `http://tool.example:8080`,
 * `chrome-extension://abcdef`, `vscode-webview://abc`, `tauri://localhost`).
 * Origins that web clients use (our own, the assistants', localhost) are
 * already allowed; this is for a browser extension, an Electron or webview app
 * or a self-hosted tool. Entries are matched exactly (the port counts, a
 * trailing slash does not match), and `*` and `null` are ignored on purpose.
 * Set it as a Worker variable or secret, for example
 * `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="chrome-extension://abcdef,https://tool.example"`.
